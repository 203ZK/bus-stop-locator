# Bus Stop Locator

As a Singaporean, I'm proud of the high-quality public transport system that we have, making it so convenient to get around the country. However, I often encounter a frustrating problem when taking the MRT: not knowing which station exits to take to get to the nearest bus stops.

As a result, I wanted to create a simple solution to solve this problem once and for all, and here it is! Made with React and node.js, this website lets Singaporeans key in an MRT station, and voila - the quickest route to all the bus stops near the station!
